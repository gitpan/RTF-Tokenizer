Revision history for Perl extension RTF::Tokenizer.

1.02   Sun Aug 31 16:10:00 2003
	* We now try to recover from badly-formed control words, meaning
	    that embeded file paths no longer cause fatal errors.
	* Escaped tabs now return '\tab'
	* Tabs are now handled correctly in text
	* \; returns an error, but no longer a fatal one
	* Text that spans multiple lines is now treated as one token
	- Removed remnants of TODO list from module...

1.01   Sun Apr 10 22:00:00 2003
	* We no longer trash $/, which is good
	* The tokenizer can be sub-classed! Yay!
	* \bin data now handled
	* new() can now invoke read_file and read_string
	* IO::File objects now accepted in read_file()
	- Added some debugging to read_file() to catch weirdness
	- Sanitized regular expressions
	- Created the _get_line() subroutine
	- Corrected documentation about read_file() behaviour
