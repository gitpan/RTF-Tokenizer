| RTF::Tokenizer - Version 1.0 - Peter Sergeant - <rtft@clueball.com> |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+

+-> Introduction

+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                     |
|     RTF::Tokenizer is an object-orientated low-level RTF reader. If |
| you're looking to render RTF, or want a higher-level RTF processor, |
| this is not the module for you - you want RTF::Reader.  This is the |
| fifth release of RTF::Tokenizer - version 1.0 boasts a huge jump in |
| performance and a complete rewrite - tokenizing a 1 MB file used to |
| take 22 seconds  on my machine  -  it now takes 2 seconds.  Certain |
| control words are now handled in a way which makes a lot more sense |
| and a lot of cruft has been  removed ( bookmarks,  jump to control, |
| entity-handling, font-table handling). This will probably break all |
| your old scripts. Sorry, but it had to be done.                     |
|                                                                     |

|     Here's a bit of code that demonstrates almost all functionality |
| and will hopefully give you a quick  insight into how the module is |
| used - full docs, are, of course, available in POD.                 |
|                                                                     |

|     print "\\$argument$param\n" if $type eq 'control';              |

|     * Only very  basic tests  exist at the  moment.  More  would be |
|       better,  but they're oh-so boring to write.                   |
|                                                                     |
|     * No support for \bin yet.  I *will* add this,  but I'm  yet to |
|       find it in real-world use yet, and I'm still not sure about a |
|       couple of  aspects of it.  If you have a real-world  example, |
|       send it to me, and I'll updgrade the module.                  |
