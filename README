RTF/Tokenizer version 0.01
==========================

RTF/Tokenizer takes an RTF string, and spits out tokens, for your parsing
and transformation pleasure.

Essentially, this:

  {\pard
  \qc
  \b\f3\fs40 Section 1: The Larch
  \par}

becomes:

  ['group', 1],
  ['control', 'qc', ''],
  ['control', 'b', ''],
  ['control', 'f', '3'],
  ['control', 'fs', '40'],
  ['text', 'Section 1: The Larch'],
  ['control', 'par', ''],
  ['group', 0]

There are no dependencies, and the thing is as easy to run as:

  my $object = RTF::Tokenizer->new($rtf_string);
  ...
    my ($type, $value, $extra) = $object->get_token;
  ...
